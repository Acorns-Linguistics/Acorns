The ACORNS project supports the language revitalization efforts of Native American tribes. The acorn is sacred to the tribes of Northern California and Southern Oregon who helped start this project, so the name ACORNS, is chosen in their honor. This being said, all of this software is freely downloadable and useable for any non-profit use. The applications are language-independent; in other words, they are appropriate tools to facilitate the learning of any language.

Language teachers and their students use the desktop/laptop version of ACORNS to create language lessons which, when executed, enhance language learning. ACORNS can automatically generate Web pages and mobile versions that students can execute using the Apple and Android ACORNS gallery applications. 

Installation: The downloaded Acorns repository is a zipped Eclipse Java Project. Simply extract the archive and launch it using Eclipse. The directory Acorns_lib contains necessary jar and library files. Among these are those needed for Javafx. These are only necessary when using the option to create gif files from mp4 video clips. The Acorns_lib directory is configured for a Windows platform. If you wish to run the project on Mac or Linux systems, download open-source JavaFx software and replace the respective files in Acorns_lib.
